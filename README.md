# chip8emulator 
My experience with building a CHIP-8 emulator. Big props to Austin Morlan for his blog, which I followed for the creation of this project :)

# Current Project Status 
I am currently in the process of developing this emulator. As of Jan. 20, I've gotten to loading ROM file contents, which is definitely a start. It is worth noting as well that this <strong>is NOT of my original work.</strong> This is entirely creditted to <a href="https://austinmorlan.com/posts/chip8_emulator/">Austin Morlan's blog on building a CHIP-8 emulator.</a>

My big goal with this project is to understand the making of these kind of massive projects, which is why I plan to add lots of documentation to this codebase as it expands :)
