Below is the binary data for the letter F for the Chip8:

11110000
10000000
11110000
10000000
10000000

This can also be shown in hex as: 0xF0, 0x80, 0xF0, 0x80, 0x80.

The 1s form a F shape! Each 1 in this binary data shows a pixel turned on, while 0s are pixels turned off.
This is how fonts will function in our emulator :)
